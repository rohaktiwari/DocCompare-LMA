## 0:00 - 0:30: The Problem (Hook)

*   **Screen:** Start on the landing page (Single Deal Analysis).
*   **Voiceover:** "Good afternoon. We all know the pain of syndication review. It takes 30 to 40 hours to manually cross-reference a complex facility agreement against LMA standards. In that time, 'covenant creep' slips in, and critical protections get watered down.
*   **Action:** "Today, we're showing you DocCompare LMA—a compliance assistant that turns that manual review into an instant risk assessment."

## 0:30 - 1:15: Single Deal Analysis (The "Magic")

*   **Action:** Click the dropdown and select **"Deal_Leveraged_Aggressive.txt"**. Click **"Analyze Document"**.
*   **Voiceover:** "I'm uploading a new leveraged facility. In under 2 seconds, our engine parses the critical covenants."
*   **Visual:** Show the dashboard pop up. Point to the **"Overall Risk Score: 7/10 (High)"**.
*   **Action:** Click on the **"Financial Covenants > Leverage Ratio"** deviation.
*   **Voiceover:** "Immediately, it flags a high-risk deviation. The borrower is asking for **5.5x leverage**, but our LMA standard benchmark is **4.0x**. It detects this automatically—no reading required."
*   **Key Point:** "This is powered by a deterministic rule engine, not a black-box AI. That means 100% auditability and consistency for your credit committee."

## 1:15 - 1:45: Portfolio Intelligence (The "Scale")

*   **Action:** Click the **"Add to Portfolio"** button on the results card.
*   **Action:** Navigate to the **"Portfolio Dashboard"** page.
*   **Visual:** Show the table with the new deal added. Hover over the "High Risk" deals.
*   **Voiceover:** "But we don't just look at one deal. We aggregate risk across your entire book. Here is your portfolio at a glance."
*   **Action:** Filter by **"Vintage"** or sort by **"Risk Score"**.
*   **Voiceover:** "I can instantly see that my 2019 vintage deals are solid, but my recent 2023 deals in the 'Aggressive' bucket are showing systemic weakness in Events of Default. This lets me manage portfolio risk proactively, not just deal-by-deal."

## 1:45 - 2:30: Amendment Tracking (The "Lifecycle")

*   **Action:** Navigate to **"Amendment Tracking"**.
*   **Action:** Select **"Deal_Distressed"** (Original vs. Amendment 2).
*   **Visual:** Show the redline/diff view.
*   **Voiceover:** "Finally, loans evolve. Here, I'm tracking a distressed credit. I can see exactly where we lost protection: the Cross Default threshold jumped from €5M to €20M in Amendment 2."
*   **Action:** Point to the red text.
*   **Voiceover:** "The system highlights exactly what changed, so legal counsel doesn't have to manually redline 200 pages."

## 2:30 - 3:00: Closing & ROI (The Ask)

*   **Screen:** Return to the main dashboard or a "Report" view.
*   **Voiceover:** "DocCompare LMA isn't just a reader; it's a risk shield.
    *   We reduce initial review time by **60%**.
    *   We provide a **consistent audit trail** for compliance.
    *   And we deliver **portfolio-level insights** that manual review simply can't match."
*   **Closing:** "We are ready to deploy this for your syndication desk today to stop covenant creep in its tracks. Thank you."

## Demo Tips for Success

1.  **Don't mention Regex or Code:** They don't care. They care that it's "Consistent" and "Auditable."
2.  **Focus on the "Red":** Bankers respond to risk. Show the red flags.
3.  **Smooth Transitions:** Click buttons deliberately. Don't rush the mouse.
4.  **Confidence:** Speak to the business value ("saving 30 hours"), not the feature ("it parses text").
